# Statistical Methods 2: Another Collection of Useful tools for machine learning

This repo contains a collection of Rmarkdown files implimenting a mixture of machine learning techniques, this was part of a taught course I took during my PhD, but I thought it might be useful.

Some highlights:
- Dimension eduction via PCA, FA and ICA with kernel extensions
- Gaussian Process Regression
- Cubic spline regression
- Fourier and time series analysis
- Cluster analysis with kernel extensions
