# Statistical Methods 2: Another Collection of Useful tools for machine learning

This repo contains a collection of Rmarkdown files implimenting a mixture of machine learning techniques, in both C++ and R. This was part of a taught course I took during my PhD, but I thought it might be useful for anyone else looking to learn the subjects.
Some highlights:
- Parallelising GPR and other baysian approaches via C++
- Cubic Spline approximation
- Interfacing C++ with R
- Building neural networks for tensorflow and pytorch
-
